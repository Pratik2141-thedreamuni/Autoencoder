Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data
This repository contains an autoencoder model designed for detecting anomalies in time-series data. The model leverages a neural network to reconstruct normal data and uses reconstruction error to identify anomalies.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Preprocesses and loads synthetic temperature data.
Model Training: Implements an autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras to minimize reconstruction error.
Anomaly Detection: Detects anomalies by comparing reconstruction error to a defined threshold.
Visualization: Generates plots to visualize reconstruction errors and highlight detected anomalies.
Pre-trained Weights: Pre-trained model weights are included for quick deployment and testing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Pratik2141-thedreamuni/Autoencoder.git
cd Autoencoder
Install required dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed and run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

You can run the main script to execute the model:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
The main functionality includes:

Training the autoencoder: Using the preprocessed synthetic data.
Detecting anomalies: The reconstruction error is used to flag anomalies.
Visualization: Generates a plot showing the reconstruction error and detected anomalies.
